### Course Information

* **Description**: This course is designed to provide graduate students interested in statistical genetics and genomics with an opportunity to gain or enhance knowledge in gene expression analysis by next-generation sequencing. The course is aimed at preparing students for conducting methodological research in high-throughput transcriptomic studies. The course includes two sections: bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Each section starts with biological background, followed by statistical and computational methods, and finishes with biological interpretations and follow-ups. Topics include data normalization, measurement of error models, dispersion shrinkage, dimensionality reduction, zero-inflated factor analysis, batch correction, clustering algorithm, deconvolution, pseudotime reconstruction, deep neural network, and autoencoder, etc.
